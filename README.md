# AWS Easy CLI

_"Doesn't do much, easily"_

CLI tools for doing things on AWS easier. Defaults (eg: subnet, tags etc.) only need to be supplied once via a config file, which supports multiple profiles (eg: for different regions or AWS accounts).

Currently supports the following AWS services:

* [EC2](docs/ec2.md) - manipulate EC2 instances by name, and launch them with EBS volumes of any size, as per the settings in the configuration file (subnet, tags etc).
* [SQS](docs/sqs.md) - drain configured SQS queues to a file, pretty printing deleted messages using a jq filter

## Prerequisites

* python 3.7+
* pip3
* automake & libtool  
  * Ubuntu: `sudo apt install automake libtool`
  * macOS: `brew install automake libtool`

## Install

Run the following to install the latest master version:

```
pip3 install --upgrade git+https://github.com/seek-oss/aec.git
```

Rerun the same command when you want to upgrade to the latest version.

## Configure

Before you can use aec, you will need to create the config files in `~/.aec/`.
You can use the config files provided by your organisation, or install the example config files as follows:
1. Run `make install-config` to copy example config files to `~/.aec/`
1. Modify the config files in `~/.aec/` and update any values as needed (eg: `additional_tags`)

## Similar projects

[awless](https://github.com/wallix/awless) is written in Go, and is an excellent substitute for awscli with
support for many AWS services. It has human friendly commands for use on the command line or in templates. Unlike `aec` its ec2 create instance command doesn't allow you to specify the EBS volume size, or add tags.
